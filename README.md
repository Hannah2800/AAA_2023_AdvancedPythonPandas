Hello Panda-enthusiasts, welcome to our project for the Advanced Analytics & Applications! 

We split up most tasks and subtasks into distinct folders and Jupyter notebooks. To execute the code properly, you must first install the packages (found in "requirements.txt") and save the relevant data by downloading it under the "data" folder.

In order for all notebooks to run correctly, you must first execute 'Task 1 - Data Cleaning and Preparation'.


Have fun :) 

Yours sincerely 

Advanced Python Pandas
